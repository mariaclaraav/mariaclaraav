- 🔭 I'm a Resercher Data Scientist finishing my MSc degree at UNICAMP
- 🏄 I am passionate about machine learning and a fast learner
- 🎓 I hold a Mechanical Engineering degree
  
## 🛠 Work Experience

Enthusiastic about technology and innovation, I am a data scientist with a background in mechanical engineering. I have already worked on multidisciplinary data science projects, including condition monitoring, evaluation of material microstructure, quality control, and Twitter bot detection.

- Implemented unsupervised learning techniques, including LSTM and variational autoencoders, to recognize patterns in sensor data;
- Developed models for detecting anomalies in railway tracks based on sensor data from an Instrumented Railway Vehicle;
- Applied supervised learning techniques to develop a non-destructive method for grain size evaluation using ultrasound data;
- Applied neural networks to perform coordinate system transformations of track irregularities;
- Monitored operational KPIs in a thermal power plant;
- Optimized sensor placement using Sparse Sensing.

 ## 🦄 Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels, SciKit-Learn, PyTorch and TensorFlow) and MATLAB
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
- **Time Series Forecasting and Anomaly Detection**
- **Regression and Classification**
- **Databases:** SQL
